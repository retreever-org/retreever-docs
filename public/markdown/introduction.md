# Retreever

Retreever is a zero-config toolkit that automatically generates **live API documentation** and a **built-in testing UI** for your Spring Boot application.
No YAML. No manual OpenAPI annotations. No extra controllers. Just your code — reflected into a complete API explorer.

---

### What Retreever Does

* Discovers your controllers, models, generics, and exception handlers
* Builds an always-accurate API documentation model
* Generates clean request/response schemas
* Includes validation constraints and example values
* Maps exceptions into clear error responses
* Provides a modern, Postman-like testing panel built directly into your app

---

### Why Developers Use It

* **Zero setup** — add the dependency and start your app
* **Pure code-first** — documentation derives from real behavior
* **Fast** — ~100ms startup resolution, ~30ms doc serving
* **Minimal clutter** — only a few optional annotations for descriptions/examples
* **Always up-to-date** — no manual syncing or broken specs
* **Lightweight** — small footprint, no external services

---

### What Retreever Replaces

Instead of using Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation **and** Postman for testing, Retreever gives you both in one place —
**documentation + testing unified inside your application**.

---

### When to Use Retreever

Choose Retreever if you want:

* Accurate API docs without maintaining them
* A simple testing UI for every endpoint
* Automatic error + validation awareness

* A modern alternative to annotation-heavy setups
